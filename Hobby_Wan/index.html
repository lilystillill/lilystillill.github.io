            <p>I have discovered this AI text-to-image generation tool that pushes the boundaries of how we define art. I graduated with a fine art degree. I am used to spending days and months developing the art direction of my art projects. Then I discover Midjourney, an AI bot that uses Discord commands along with users' design ideas to create artistic images. You will write a prompt describing your imagined image to the Midjourney bot. The result is instant! The prompt will be organized into several commands to depict the AI vision of your image. The AI generated images are incomparable with fine art photographs because humans and AI are creative very differently. AI creativity is very random and the image quality lacks details and resolutions. Therefore, I think AI-generated images work fine in storyboards and sketches which need to be further developed and edited in other design software. However, Midjourney gives me art direction that I would have never thought of. </p>

            <h2 id="title2">Architecture Story Telling: SkyCity</h2>
            <p>I use Midjourney to test and develop ideas quickly. Inspired by Miyazaki’s animation: Howl Moving Castles, and Tomás Saraceno’s art installations about civilization in the sky. So I have developed my first architecture idea: SkyCity, depicting a future city built in the sky. SkyCity is about the ultimately optimized interconnectivity of civil infrastructure in the sky. I am sharing three of my favorites in the gallery below.

Cantilever rooftops are private to their residents, but you can view others’ cantilever rooftops from higher up. The rich  enjoy more privacy and sunshine, living in their higher cantilevers, which are truly superior than the others.

Overpass bridges have multiple layers with apartments and shops built on top, and trains in the bottom. Image a super long corridor with apartments on both sides.
